# CMPM 121 S6 Project

This section activity is experimenting with agentic coding tools.

## Food Diary App

A small client-side food diary web app was added. It lets you quickly add what you ate, stores entries in your browser (localStorage), and shows daily and weekly summaries.

How to run locally:

```bash
deno task dev
```

Open the dev server shown by the task (Vite) in your browser. Entries are saved only in your browser's local storage.

Files of interest:

- `src/main.ts` — app UI and logic
- `src/style.css` — app styles
